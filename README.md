# Phylogenetics-NGS

Code and notes for processing of UCE (ultraconserved elements) DNA sequence data, mainly for _Plethodon serratus_ project.

Some code run locally (bash, Python), but most of these files are for running scripts on HPC (HPC @ LSU or LONI).

<code>0_Plethodon_UCE_processing_commands.txt</code> is a reference file containing a running list of all the commands + my notes.

# GIS

Also included some R scrips for downloading, processing, and analysis of GIS data (mainly of species range maps).
