Some files for submission of _Plethodon serratus_ UCE sequences to NCBI

Not included: the sequence files themselves (fsa, tbl; or sqn, val from Sequin) due to file size. But final sequence data are deposited at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA345492/
